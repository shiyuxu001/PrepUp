Let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes.\r\nPreheat oven to 550F.\r\nStretch the first ball with your hands on a clean countertop. Stretch it as thin as you can, the goal here is to see your countertop through the dough.\r\nFold the dough over itself to form a square brushing in between folds with the butter mixture.\r\nSet aside and start making the next ball.\r\nStretch the second one thin as we have done for the first ball.\r\nPlace the previous one on the middle seam side down. Fold the outer one over brushing with more butter mixture as you fold. Set aside.\r\nKeep doing this for the third and fourth balls. Now we have one ready, place on a 10 inch baking\/pie dish seam side down and brush the top with more butter.\r\nRepeat for the remaining 4 balls to make a second one. With your hands lightly press the folded feteer to spread it on the baking dish.\r\nPlace in preheated oven for 10 minutes when the feteer starts puffing turn on the broiler to brown the top.\r\nWhen it is done add little butter on top and cover so it won\u2019t get dry.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/9f4z6v1598734293.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-mW1unsVhFU","strIngredient1":"Flour","strIngredient2":"Water","strIngredient3":"Salt","strIngredient4":"Unsalted Butter","strIngredient5":"Olive Oil","strIngredient6":"","strIngredient7":"","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"4 cups ","strMeasure2":"1 1\/2 cups ","strMeasure3":"1\/4 tsp","strMeasure4":"1 cup ","strMeasure5":"1\/4 cup","strMeasure6":" ","strMeasure7":" ","strMeasure8":" ","strMeasure9":" ","strMeasure10":" ","strMeasure11":" ","strMeasure12":" ","strMeasure13":" ","strMeasure14":" ","strMeasure15":" ","strMeasure16":" ","strMeasure17":" ","strMeasure18":" ","strMeasure19":" ","strMeasure20":" ","strSource":"https:\/\/amiraspantry.com\/egyptian-feteer-meshaltet\/","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null}, {"idMeal":"52980","strMeal":"Stamppot","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Pork","strArea":"Dutch","strInstructions":"\r\nWash and peel the potatoes and cut into similarly sized pieces for even cooking.\r\n\r\nIn a large soup pot, boil the potatoes and the bay leaves in salted water for 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using a bag of ready-cut curly kale, wash the bunches thoroughly under cool running water to get rid of all soil\u2014you wouldn't want that gritty texture in your finished dish. Trim any coarse stems and discard any brown leaves. With a sharp knife, cut the curly kale into thin strips.\r\n\r\nPeel and chop the shallots.\r\n\r\nIn a frying pan or skillet, melt 1 tbsp. of butter and saute the shallots for a few minutes before adding the curly kale and 2 tbsp. of water.
